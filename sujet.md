# Static analysis

## Instructions

Some of the exercises in this practical session use PMD, JavaParser or require a full project as input.

To obtain and use PMD, consult the instructions given in https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_userdocs_installation.html

The folder [javaparser-starter](code/javaparser-starter) contains the code of an application that uses JavaParser to print all public classes and public methods from a given project. You can use this example as a starting point for all exercises using JavaParser.

We recommend you use the following projects as input for the exercises:

- [Apache Commons Collections](https://github.com/apache/commons-collections)
- [Apache Commons CLI](https://github.com/apache/commons-cli)
- [Apache Commons Math](https://github.com/apache/commons-math)
- [Apache Commons Lang](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang)

Feel free to use any other project you want.
